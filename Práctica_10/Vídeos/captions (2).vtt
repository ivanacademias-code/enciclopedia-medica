We will analyze the anatomy of a modern web page based on the files of the "MiniEnciclopedia." Let's start with the skeleton: the

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
HTML. Index.html shows us the key semantic structure: a header for the logo, a main for

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the main content, and a footer for the closing information. An interactive feature we see is image maps.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Using the map and area tags, we can define clickable zones within a single image, like the diagram of the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
human body. For user interaction, contacto.html implements a form. This is crucial for collecting data. We see the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000
use of input, label for accessibility, and fieldset to group fields. Finally, everything looks so good thanks to CSS. Estructura

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Principal.css uses flexbox for a flexible layout, CSS variables to unify the design, and media query to make it responsive

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
on mobile devices.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Thank you.
